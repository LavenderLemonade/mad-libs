# About This Project

So I made this just to be a simple, getting use to C# type of project. Something to help me learn C# while also getting used to using Git and GitHub. 

The point of this project is to eventually make a madlibs program with a GUI that can import a madib text file and then prompt the user to fill in the blanks, and from there display the filled in madlib.
