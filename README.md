# About This Project

So I made this just to be a simple, getting use to C# type of project. Something to help me learn C# while also getting used to using Git and GitHub. 

The point of this project is to eventually make a madlibs program with a GUI that can import a madib text file and then prompt the user to fill in the blanks, and from there display the filled in madlib. 

## Current Project Status

The program can take in a text file and replace instances of any number of underscores with data input from the user. Going to be adding in a menu option so that the user can import a madlib and complete it, and then go back to the menu and either do it again or import another one.
