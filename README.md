# About This Project

So I made this just to be a simple, getting use to C# type of project. Something to help me learn C# while also getting used to using Git and GitHub. 

The point of this project is to eventually make a madlibs program with a GUI that can import a madib text file and then prompt the user to fill in the blanks, and from there display the filled in madlib. 

## Current Project Status

The program can take in a text file with spaces of specifically 3 underscores, and then replace those underscores with words input by the user. Next steps will be either working towards being able to replace sections of undercores regardless of number, or moving towards implementing the GUI.
