# About This Project

So I made this just to be a simple, getting use to C# type of project. Something to help me learn C# while also getting used to using Git and GitHub. 

The point of this project is to eventually make a madlibs program with a GUI that can import a madib text file and then prompt the user to fill in the blanks, and from there display the filled in madlib. 

## Current Project Status

The program can take in a text file and replace instances of any number of underscores with data input from the user. Next step is going to be working on Exception Handling, and then maybe the GUI.
