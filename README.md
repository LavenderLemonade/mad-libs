# About This Project

So I made this just to be a simple, getting use to C# type of project. Something to help me learn C# while also getting used to using Git and GitHub. 

The point of this project is to eventually make a madlibs program with a GUI that can import a madib text file and then prompt the user to fill in the blanks, and from there display the filled in madlib. 

## Current Project Status

The program can take in a string with specific, 3 underscore spaces, and replace them with words that the user has input into the program. Next steps will be either pulling in a text file, or seeing if I can modify the program so that I grabs series of underscores irrespective of the size of them, and then replaces those with words.
